			<h2>ABOUT SNOMO DAYS</h2>
			<p>The annual SnoMo Days event, hosted by the Alberta Beach & District Lions Club, returns on February 15-17, 2025, marking its 44th anniversary! Originally a snowmobile event, SnoMo Days has grown into a full weekend of family-friendly activities, including an ATV rally, broom ball, over-the-line softball, an icebreaker party, pony rides, and more.</p>
			<p>This beloved event brings together community groups like the LSA Army Cadets, Alberta Beach Snowmobile Club, and many others who volunteer their time to make SnoMo Days a success. Thanks to the generous support from our Title Sponsor, Travel Alberta, and many local sponsors, SnoMo Days continues to thrive as a celebration of winter and community spirit. All proceeds benefit local charities, and additional funds raised go directly back to our community.</p>
			<p>
			We invite you to join us for a memorable weekend and encourage you to get involved by volunteering or sponsoring the event. Together, let’s make this year’s SnoMo Days unforgettable!

			<h2>ABOUT LIONS CLUB</h2>
			<p>The Alberta Beach & District Lions Club, a nonprofit organization, is dedicated to serving the community through various charitable initiatives and events, including the beloved SnoMo Days festival. As part of the Lions of Alberta Foundation, we unite with Lions Clubs across Alberta to make a greater impact. Where individual clubs may lack resources for a project, the Foundation enables collaboration, turning ambitious community projects into realities. Through the Foundation, we also provide tax-deductible receipts to help raise funds for Canadian community initiatives, supporting our mission to create positive change across the province.</p>
