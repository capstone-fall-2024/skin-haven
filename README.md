## Workflow process.

### 1- Start a new branch with a semantic name. (ie. adding theme.json or updating theme.json)
### 2- Make sure your are commiting your changes to your branch and not the main.
### 3- After completing your code create a pull request. 
### 4- After the pull request has been approved by the members you can merge the updated content with the main branch.
### 5- Delete the branch you created. (to delete the branch go to branches and click the trash can icon on the right side of your branch)
### 6- Repeat the proccess each time your start working on a new section of code.
